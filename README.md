# Programming-in-Linux

**Programming Assignments in the class CS288 (Programming in Linux) in C and shell.**

**1. HW1**
- **Count.sh** creates a table of counters for the commands under /bin in alphabetical order
- **Reverse.sh** reverses the contents of a directory passed as a parameter
- **Filter.sh** prints those files/directories that have the size greater than the average file size of the directory
- **Insert-sort.sh** sorts a list of command line parameters in ascending order 

**2. HW2** 
- **Create.sh** creates a directory tree with depth d and breadth b in a programmable depth/breadth-first fashion, where depth-first or breadth-first can be crontrolled by a command line parameter

**3. HW3** 
- Download a YouTube HTML page, and extract the strings with information: titles, user, upload_time, duration, views. Save those lines to a txt file and then construct a csv table with those five columns using regex 

**4. HW4** 
- A C program that prints a memory map based on command line arguments 

**5. HW5**
- A C program that creates a single linked list of information from HW3 (titles, user, upload-time, duration, and views) 

**6. HW6**
- A C program that compares four sorting functions: selection, merge, integer radix and float radix sort

**7. HW7**
- A C program for three search strategies: depth first, breadth first, and intelligent search

**7. HW8**
-  a Bash script that downloads the stock web page every minute for an hour and calls a python program that injects stock information into a mySQL table. 
A PHP script is called to retrieve data from the mysql database and present them on a browser.

**7. HW9**
-  2 C programs for computing dot product that will run on any number of cores or comptuers using MPI using point to point comunication using MPI_Send() and MPI_Recv() and collective communication using MPI_Scatter() and MPI_Gather()
